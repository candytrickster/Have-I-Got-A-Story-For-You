Title: Captain's Log

Story: Captain's Log, I have started to loose track of the days. I can't even remember the month anymore. The last time I had human contact was before my radio battery died. I couldn't even tell them my location. I'm alone, scared, and cold. It was warmer when I first landed here. A nice warm July afternoon of just sailing on my boat. When suddenly like out of a movie a storm hits, and completely destroys my ship along with almost everything else. I was able to keep my phone alive for about a week, thanks to a battery pack I had, but no cell phone reception made contact difficult.
