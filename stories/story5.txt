Title: The Game

Story: It the start of the first game of the season. Kim steps up to the mound and begins her warm-up. She decides to just throw fastballs during her warm-up. Then the first batter stepped up to the plate, she was one of Kim's best friends, but on the field she's her greatest rival. Kim knew exactly where to throw the ball to keep her friend from getting a hit, but hitting those locations were risky. Kim decides to throw a fastball inside to start it off, strike. A great start to the first season. Kim knew she needed to try and get the batter to chase a pitch, so she throws a curve outside, ball. Disappointed that her rival didn't swing Kim moves on to her next pitch. She decides on another fastball this time low and outside, ball. Now the count is two balls one strike. Kim decides this time its best to throw a riser, foul. Her rival just missed the pitch sending the ball straight back. Kim now thinks its best to try and have the batter chase a pitch in the dirt, ball. With the count full Kim decides she needs to try and throw a high inside pitch, something her rival almost always swings at. Kim winds up and throws with everything she's got, stike 3.
