Title: The Villain

Story: It was a cold and stormy night, but unlike other nights. Tonight the Riddler, Edward Nygma, gets to come home to his family. His wife of 20 years keeps telling him how much of a failure he is about not killing Batman, and constantly nags him about taking out the trash. His two children, Sally and James, are the most spoiled kids. They get everything that they could ever want and give their father no love. As the Edward comes close to the door, he's greeted by his family. "Another failed attempt I see", said his wife. What Edward says next surprised his entire family.
