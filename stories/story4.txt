Title: The Woods

Story: One day, while walking through the woods close to his house, James saw something peculiar. It looked like a cabin, but could have been a hut. James decided not investigate any further this day, he instead decided to think of a plan about what he could do since he found this cabin. What could be beyond those walls he thought. What creature could be in there. About a week past before James finally had enough courage to once again approach the cabin. It was a Saturday morning before his parents woke that he went out. As he walked to the cabin James' heart felt like it was in his throat. But he knew he must continue to the cabin. There it was, just sitting there. James just stood there like a deer in headlights. Five minutes felt like hours, then James headed to the door. As he reached for the door he heard a sound.
